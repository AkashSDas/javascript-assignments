      <h1>Theme Changer</h1>
      <p>
        In contemporary literary studies, a theme is a central topic, subject,
        or message within a narrative. Themes can be divided into two
        categories: a work's thematic concept is what readers "think the work is
        about" and its thematic statement being "what the work says about the
        subject"
